# Groundhog Wanted
On Saturday March 23rd, the famous _Punxsutawney Phil_ is now a wanted  
criminal in Monroe County. Officials believe that his **crime** was to incorrectly  
predict the coming of Spring, which was proven by the recent storm in New York.  
Said one wanted poster:   
>We are now on the 2nd day of spring. And we are in the middle of yet  
another snowstorm.

So far, Phil remains safe in his home state of Pennsylvania. However,  
there are recent reports that similar weather patterns have been occurring  
around the country:
* In [Chicago](https://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/stories/) this week, the weather continues to be very chilly for Spring
* Several [storms](http://abcnews.go.com/US/winter-weather-returns-separate-storms-easter-weekend/story?id=54143950) have occurred throughout this past weekend in the Midwest
* This weather is some of the worst that [Montana](http://www.ktvh.com/2018/03/wicked-wintry-weather-blasts-montana-for-easter-weekend) has ever seen.
